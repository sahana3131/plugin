# plugin
To implement the SFTP export plugin for Metabase,we will need to follow these general steps:
1.	Create a new Metabase plugin project by following the Metabase plugin development guide (https://www.metabase.com/docs/latest/developing-plugins.html).
2.	Add the necessary dependencies to your project for interacting with SFTP servers. You can use a Java library such as JSch or Apache Commons VFS.
3.	Implement a configuration page for the plugin, where the user can specify the SFTP server's hostname, port, username, and password, as well as the remote folder where the exported data should be stored. You can use html to create the UI for the configuration page.
4.	Implement the SFTP connection and authentication by using the library you have chosen in step 2. The library should provide methods for connecting to an SFTP server, authenticating with a username and password, and creating an SFTP session.
5.	Implement the export functionality for the plugin by using Metabase's built-in export functionality to export the data from the dashboard in the desired format (such as CSV or JSON). Once you have the data in the desired format, you can use a Java library such as OpenCSV or Jackson to write the data to a file.
6.	Implement the file transfer functionality by using the SFTP library that you used in step 2 to transfer the exported data file to the remote SFTP folder. The library should provide methods for uploading files to the SFTP server.
7.	Include error-handling code throughout the plugin to catch any exceptions that may occur during the SFTP connection, data export, or file transfer. You can use a Java class such as JOptionPane to display error messages to the user if something goes wrong.
8.	Test the plugin thoroughly to ensure that it works as expected and is reliable.
9.	Document the plugin so that others can understand how to use it and configure it.
10.	Finally, you can make the plugin available to others by publishing it on a platform such as GitHub or the Metabase plugin marketplace.
